Have no clue how to handle positioning and sizing of the canvas. Maybe [This Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63403700/how-to-get-p5-js-to-create-canvas-at-certain-position) or [This wiki page](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Positioning-your-canvas) will help.

I gotta look into how colour works. Sometimes it can just be a string but there's also a built-in p5.color object interface?

Also gotta figure out how to handle points. Currently there's a lot of code embedded in the UI and Pig classes... I don't want to have hella class methods needing hella parameters.
